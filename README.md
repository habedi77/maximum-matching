# COMP 7720 Graph Algorithms

## Reproduce Results:
* Run any of the aggregate scripts located in the root folder. Note that, aggregate_full_mp is designed to take full advatnge of the cpu cores and requires a high amount of memmory, aggregate_single runs the tests one by one, taking longer needing less memory and aggregate_testing is in between. Resulting excel files for each of the cases will be generated in the results folder located in the root directory.
* Run the result_sum script to get a summary of all the tests.
