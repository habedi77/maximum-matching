    Oblivious algorithm

    The oblivious algorithm performs a “one shot” trial for each unknown_node j, 
    where it attempts to match j to a random neighbor. 
    The algorithm is unaware of which known_nodes are already matched, 
    so an attempted match to an already matched known_nodes means that unknown_node j is dropped.
